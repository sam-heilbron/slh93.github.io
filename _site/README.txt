Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

  I have correctly implemented all aspects of the assignment. 

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

  I collaborated with Akshi V. We discussed aspects of html and css but never typed for the other person.
  
Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

  I spent about 5 hours on this assignment. 


Note: I ran into issues along the way with the GIT repository so I had to remove and re-add it a bunch of times. Therefore, a majority of my git updates were lost because when I re-added my work, it was what had been already done and I was forced to do this process at the end.
