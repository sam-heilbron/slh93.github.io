					<p> I am regarded as one of the greatest baseball players of all time. I played for the Chicago Cubs
					Cubs in the 50s and 60s and was the first black player on the team. 
					</p>
					<p> After growing up in Dallas, Texas, I was drafted into the U.S. Army and served during the 
					Korean War. Shortly thereafter, I signed with the Cubs and quickly became one of the best 
					players for the franchise. </p>
					<p> I have now been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, had my number 14 retired by
					the Cubs and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. </p>
					<p> Who am I?</p>
